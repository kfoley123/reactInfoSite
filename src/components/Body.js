            <p>
                I'm a self-taught front end developer in the process of
                expanding my knowledge to become full stack. I believe that
                functionaility and form should co-exist so that not only does
                everything work, it looks great at the same time.
            </p>
            <h1>Interests</h1>
            <p>
                I am interested in travel, all things crafty but particularly
                sewing and clothing design. I'm into all things nerdy and love
                video games. Matcha keeps me going.
            </p>
        </div>
